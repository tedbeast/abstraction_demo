 * You can use this class to create DuplicateFinder objects made using classes that implement DuplicateFinder.

 * For instance, changing DuplicateFinder setDF; to DuplicateFinder setDF = new HashSetDuplicateFinder();
 * after which you can write code such as setDF.addItem(1); and setDF.isDuplicate(1);
 *
 * This, of course, would require you to create a class 'HashSetDuplicateFinder' which implements DuplicateFinder.
 * Try creating a couple different implementations of DuplicateFinder and calling their methods here.
