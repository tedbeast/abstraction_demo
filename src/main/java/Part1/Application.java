 * You can use this class to create Vehicle objects made using classes that implement Vehicle.
 *
 * For instance, changing Vehicle vehicle1; to Vehicle vehicle1 = new Car;
 * after which you can write code such as vehicle1.stop() and vehicle1.go().
 *
 * This, of course, would require you to create a class 'Car' which implements Vehicle.
 * Try creating a couple different implementations of Vehicle and calling their stop() and go() methods here.
